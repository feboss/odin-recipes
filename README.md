# H1 First assigment of the odin project

We try to complete the first assigmenet of the project:

Create a simple recipe webpage with several html file
- Index.html
- recipes\Pizza.html
- recipes\carbonara.html
- recipes\cheesecake.html

The recipe page should have the following content:
- An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier. You can find images of the dish on Google or the recipe site we linked to earlier.
- Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
- Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
- Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.
